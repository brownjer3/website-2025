# Removed Content Tracking

This document tracks content that was removed from the website due to lack of verification in the resume, but which could potentially be added back with proper documentation or metrics.

## Hero Section Stats

### Removed Stats
- **"15+ Projects Shipped"** - No specific count of projects in resume

2. **"Reduced API response times by 60% through optimization"**
