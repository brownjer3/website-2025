I've had the pleasure of working with Jerry for over a year at Bluepine, and he’s been a key contributor to both our product and engineering culture.

Jerry took the lead on building and maintaining our Airtable-based infrastructure, which acted as a prototype and launchpad for several core features of our in-app software. His work allowed us to track Home Manager delivery and homeowner onboarding long before we had those capabilities in our product—helping us move fast while learning from real users.

He also drove many of the Airtable-to-Zapier automations that powered early customer onboarding and internal operations. His solutions were clean, reliable, and surprisingly elegant given the constraints. That work laid the foundation for smoother productization down the line.

Jerry is also the kind of engineer who gets up to speed fast and isn’t afraid to challenge assumptions. He consistently brings thoughtful, outside-the-box perspectives to technical discussions—whether it's around feature design, implementation trade-offs, or process improvements.

He's sharp, collaborative, and always ready to take ownership. Any team would benefit from having Jerry on board.I've had the pleasure of working with Jerry for over a year at Bluepine, and he’s been a key contributor to both our product and engineering culture.

Jerry came over to stickK from Meetup as a product manager. Jerry hit the ground running; he is an eager and capable learner having absorbed a heavy crash course from our UX lead in order to contribute meaningful product work within weeks. Jerry consistently looks for ways to improve -- asking to sit in on meetings, enrolling in outside courses related to his work, etc. Jerry was swiftly promoted, serving as our de facto product lead after less than two years on the job. Jerry willingly wore more many hats at stickK; he's a great team player who takes on plenty of responsibilities that are not part of his core competency. And on a personal note, Jerry is also a fun, kind, happy, and engaging personality to have around the office. He will add value to any workplace culture!
