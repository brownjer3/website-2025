### Years of Experience Claims
The website assigns specific years of experience to each skill that cannot be verified from the resume.

---

## 6. Critical Findings

### 1. **Project Metrics Fabrication Risk**
The website presents 6 detailed case studies with specific metrics (user counts, revenue figures, performance improvements) that have NO basis in the resume. This is the most serious discrepancy.

### 2. **Skills Inflation**
Multiple programming languages and tools are listed on the website that don't appear in the resume, including claims of "expert" level proficiency with specific year counts.

### 3. **Quantitative Claims Without Support**
- "15+ Projects Shipped" (hero section)
- "30K+ daily active users" (about section)
- Specific percentage improvements and dollar amounts in projects

### 4. **Technology Additions**
Each experience role on the website includes additional technologies not mentioned in the resume.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### High Priority Changes Needed:

1. **Remove or Revise All Project Case Studies**
   - Either remove the projects section entirely OR
   - Rewrite to only include verifiable projects mentioned in resume achievements
   - Remove all unverifiable metrics

2. **Align Skills Section with Resume**
   - Remove skills not listed in resume
   - Remove years of experience claims
   - Keep only the technologies explicitly mentioned

3. **Update Hero Section**
   - Remove "15+ Projects Shipped" claim
   - Consider removing GitHub commits if not verifiable

4. **Revise About Section**
   - Remove "5K to 30K+ users" claim
   - Align API improvement percentage with resume (40%, not 60%)
   - Remove "15+ production features" claim
   - Remove "40% engagement increase" claim

### Information That Can Stay:
- All experience section content (matches resume exactly)
- Basic role and company information
- Technologies mentioned in resume
- General statements about product-minded approach
- 10 years in tech claim

---

## 8. Conclusion

The website contains significant embellishments and unverifiable claims, particularly in the Projects and Skills sections. While the Experience section accurately reflects the resume, the addition of specific metrics, project case studies, and expanded skill sets creates a misleading representation of verifiable accomplishments.

**Risk Level: HIGH** - The discrepancies could damage credibility if discovered during background checks or technical interviews.

**Recommendation: Immediate revision to align all content with resume-verifiable information only.**
